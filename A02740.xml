            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Wherein as they doe moſt blaſphemouſly preferre their owne inuented idoll, before Gods moſt holy ordinance: So doe they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wray their ignorance, touching the neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitie and efficacie of the word preached. If they would duely conſider the ſcope and doctrine of this parable, they might eaſily perceiue, that the hearing of the word, is as neceſſarily required for the direction of their liues, and the ſaluation of their ſoules: As the ſowing of the ground with good ſeed, is neceſſarily required of them that would reape a plentifull crop at har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueſt. And that it is not the ſight of their abhominables doll, but the reuerend hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of Gods ſacred word, that muſt make them fruitfull in all good workes.</p>
            <p>Againe, wee cannot but acknowledge, that the Lord hath ſent many skilfull and painefull Husbandmen, to ſome his fields with vs: who according to their office and
<pb facs="tcp:17428:4"/>dutie, ſow it in due ſeaſon, after a good maner, and with the beſt ſeede. And yet it yeeldeth litle fruite. People heare much, learne litle, and practiſe leſſe. Which can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be imputed to the want of good prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching, but at her to the want of good hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring: the fault is rather in the ground, then in the ſower, or in the ſeede. The ſeede is good, and great ſtore is ſowne, but the ground is barren. The doctrine is ſound, and the maner of teaching profita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, but the people heare amiſſe, and ſo for want of good hearing, looſe the fruite of many good ſermons; becauſe the profit of hearing, dependeth on the maner of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring. A medicine fitly preſcribed and rightly compounded, looſeth his vertue in curing the patients diſeaſe, if it be not duly adminiſtred, and orderly receiued. We to our great grieſe looſe our labour in prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching, and the people to their great perill, looſe their labour in hearing, becauſe they heare amiſſe. As therefore I was at firſt enduced to preach thoſe ſermons. ſo was I afterward perſwaded to penne them, that by them the ſimpler ſorte (for whoſe ſake onely I do now publiſh them I might haue ſome plain direction how to heare for their profit.</p>

Leſt any ſhould imagine, that by any kind of hearing, they might be ſaued, he lets them vndeiſtand, that there be bad hearers as well as good. And becauſe many of them were husbandmen, who liued by tilling and ſowing of land; and all of them were well acquainted with matters of that nature, for their better capacitic he ſetched his ſimilitude from husbandry.</p>
            <p>This parable is firſt propounded,
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:17428:12"/>then expounded; propounded in the 5.6.7.8. verſes of this chapter: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of I for beare to ſpeake, becauſe the doctrines thereof, may be better con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered in the expoſition.</p>
            <p>It pleaſed Chriſt for the inſtruction of his diſciples, and for the edification of his Church in future ages, to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound this parable. And it is the firſt parable which wee ſind penned with his expoſition. The occaſion of the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition is ſet downe in the two verſes immediately going before: namely a queſtion moued by the Apoſtles, what ſhould be the meaning of it. And a rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon rendred by Chriſt why he would explane it to them, and not to others, becauſe it was giuen to them to knowe the myſteries of the kingdome of God, but not to others.</p>
            <p>Now in the verſes following, is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teyned the matter of the expoſition, which is double: the former reſpects the ſeede: the later reſpects the ground: The ſeede faith Chriſt, <hi>is the word of God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The ground was of ſoure kinds, and ſignifieth 4. forts of hearers.</p>
            <p n="1">
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:17428:13"/> 1 The firſt kind of ground was the high way. What hearers are ſignifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed thereby, is declared here, verſ. 12. and more may be ſupplied out of Math. 13.19. touching whom we may obſerue 2. things, 1. the manner of their hearing, 2. the iſſue and euent of their hearing: 1. the manner of their hearing is not here expreſſed, yet is mentioned, Math. 13.19. <hi>they heare and vnderſtand not.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. The iſſue and euent of their hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring: which is ſet forth by the diuells practiſe and behauiour toward them. And that is deſcribed, 1. by the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler, 2. by the end of it, 1. by the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of it; for he is ſaid to come and take the word out of their hearts, 2. by the end, wherefore he doth ſo, which is double, he doth it to preuent 2. things which they might receiue by hearing, the one being ſubordinate to the other, the former being a meane of the later, and the later being a reward of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer: the one is, leaſt they ſhould be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieue: the later is, leaſt they ſhould be ſaued.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The ſecond kind of ground was
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:17428:13"/>ſtony: who are ment thereby, is ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, verſ. 13. Another ſort of vnprofita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble hearers, who are deſcribed by 4. properties, whereof the two firſt, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare their preſent eſtate, and the two laſt, their future condition: 1. they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue the word with joy: 2. they haue no rootes: 3. they belieue for a while: 4. In time of temptation they fall away.</p>
            <p n="3">3. The third kind of ground was thornie: which alſo repreſenteth ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſort of bad hearets; deſcribed verſ. 14. by the cauſes, and by the effect or iſſue by the cauſes; for 3. things are named, which like thornes choake the ſeede of the word, 1. cares, 2. riches, 3. voluptuous liuing: by the effect, or iſſue that followeth thereupon, they bring forth no fruite.</p>
            <p n="4">4. The fourth and laſt kind of grou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d, was good ground, in which the ſeede ſprang vp and did beare fruit. That is a reſemblance of good hearers, as appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth, verſ. 15. And thoſe are deſcribed by 3. properties: 1. by the manner of their hearing: <hi>they heare with an honeſt and good hart:</hi> 2. by their keeping of it af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter they haue heard it: 3. by their fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulnes.
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:17428:14"/>And that is amplified 2. waies, 1. by the maner of it, heare, <hi>with patience:</hi> 2. by the meaſure and varietie of it: ſome bring forth more, ſome leſte, in Math. 13.23. Mar. 4.20. ſome thirty, ſome ſix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, ſome an hundied fold.</p>
            <p n="1">1. To begin firſt with the firſt, and ſo to proceed in order to the reſt, Chriſt ſheweth what is ment by the ſeede, when no ſaith the ſeede is the word of God. By which tytle is plainely mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſted the vertue, force and efficare of Gods word.

Moreouer, it is to be obſerued, that Chriſt compareth the word to ſeede that is ſowne: for in the propounding of the parable, he ſaid the <hi>ſower went out to ſowe his ſeede:</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Verſ.</hi> 5.</note> and now he ſaith the ſeede is the word: meaning the ſeede ſowne. <hi>Mathew</hi> ſaith,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Math.</hi> 13.19.</note> that the <hi>diuell catcheth away the word ſowne in the heart.</hi> And <hi>Marke</hi> ſaith,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Mar.</hi> 4.4.</note> that the <hi>ſower ſoweth the word.</hi> And therefore it muſt needs be vnderſtood of the word prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched. The word of God as it is written in the ſcriptures, and conteyned in the bookes of the old and new teſtament, is good ſeede indeed: yet it is as ſeede in the barne vnthraſhed, or as ſeede laid
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:17428:15"/>vp in the garner: but the word read and expounded, preached and applyed to Gods people, is as ſeede ſowne in a field. And preachers be the ſowers of it: for albeit Chriſt doth not expreſly declare who be the ſowers, yet that is apparant from other circumſtances: for if the word be the ſeede ſowne, then they who preach the word are the ſow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers. And if they who heare the word taught, be the ground in which the ſeede is ſowne: then the perſons who teach them, and whom they heare, are the ſowers. So Chriſt by preaching the word, was a ſower, yea the chiefeſt of all others: the ground was his, the ſeede was his, &amp; he like a good husbandman, with his owne hands, did ſowe his own ſeede in his owne field.<note place="margin">Athanaſ. de ſement.</note> So the Apoſtles were likewiſe ſowers. Chriſt was a ſower to the Iewes onely, they alſo to the gentiles: he in the little field of <hi>Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dea,</hi> they in the large field of the whole world.<note place="margin">1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 9.11.1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.9.</note> Wherfore S. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaid, <hi>If we haue ſowme vnto you ſperituall things, is it a great thing if we reape your carnall things?</hi> as al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo, <hi>we together are Gods labourers, ye are Gods husbandry.</hi> And ſo all thoſe who
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:17428:15"/>preach the ſame word which they did, are ſowers: for as the ſower filleth his hand with ſeede, and caſteth it abroad among the furrowes of the field, not ſetting it ſeede by ſeede, or chooſing a peculiar place for euery ſeede, but lets it lye as it lighteth: So the preacher diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſeth and diſpenſeth the word in a mixt people, not able to guie it ſucceſſe, but as it pleaſeth God to giue a bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing, and as the hearts of the hearers are prepared for it.</p>
            <p>Hence then wee may learne the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſitie of preaching, no ſowing, no rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping. As you cannot in any field reape a crop of corne at harueſt, vnles it were ſowne with good ſeede at the ſeede time, no more can any fruits of grace, or any good works, bee found in the Church, or children of God, vnleſſe the ſeede of the worde bee ſowne among them.

               <p>The ſecond propertie in the firſt kind of hearers, is ſet forth by the iſſue
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:17428:28"/>and euent that falles out at his hearing: The diuell comes and takes the word from him. The former propertie came from himſelfe, this from the diuell.</p>
               <p>In this behauiour of the diuell, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward theſe hearers, wee may note 2. things. 1. his preſence: 2. his practiſe.</p>
               <p n="1">1. His preſence, in that he is ſaid to come, he commeth to the perſons that doe heare, and to the places where they heare. Though here it be tranſlated (afterward) commeth the diuell: yet it might be tranſlated,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Mar.</hi> 4.15.</note> 
                  <hi>then commeth the diuell. Marke</hi> ſaith, that Sathan com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth immediately, to wit, as ſoone as they haue heard, and before they goe away from the place, as well as after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward. Euen as fowles come to the field that is ſowne, ſo will the diuell come to the perſons that heare. This is to be conſidered, becauſe it is not ſimply ſaid, the diuell taketh the word: but all three Euangeliſis adde this, he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth. And this not onely teacheth vs,<note place="margin">Tollet. in Luk. <hi>8.</hi> annot. <hi>26.</hi>
                  </note> as ſome haue obſerued, that the diuell is out of vs, is not alwaies preſent; is ſometime neere, ſometime a farre off:
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:17428:28"/>ſometime tempteth, ſometime temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth not. But likewiſe that he neither feareth the perſons that heare Gods word, nor the place where they heare it.<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Iob.</hi> 1.6.</note> He came to <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eue</hi> while they were in Paradiſe, he came and ſtood before the Lord, among the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of God: that is, the holy Angells. He approached neere to Chrifts moſt holy body,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Math.</hi> 4.5.8.</note> and carried it from one place to another. We muſt not there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore thinke it ſtrange, that he dare come among them, that meete together for the hearing of Gods word, and into Churches which be conſecrated and dedicated for the worſhip of the Lord. Papifts imagine that the ringing of conſecrated bells, will driue him away: And that permanent croſſes of mettall and wood, and tranſient croſſes made on the forhead with their fingers, will put him to flight. Let them ſhew why he ſhould be more afraid of theſe, then of Chriſts body? haue they more holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, or more vertue in them, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Chriſts body had?</p>
               <p>Seeing the diuell comes to hearers, let vs before we heare, and afterward
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:17428:29"/>we haue heard, arme our ſelues againſt him.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The diuels practiſe, <hi>he taketh the word out of their hearts:</hi> The heart is not here taken ſtrictly and properly, but generally, for the minde and affections: yet cannot the diuell immediately, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly, &amp; by himſelfe, worke vpon the ſoule or heart of man, that belongeth onely vnto God, who alone is the ſear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher of the heart. The diuell worketh immediately, indirectly, &amp; by meanes euen by externall objects, outward ſenſes, and corporall phantaſies; he ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth the word out of the hart, by inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupting the phantaſie, and making it vnfit to conuey any thing to the vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding or to the heart: and by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueying other thoughts into the heart, and turning the minde another way, ſo as it ſhall no longer affect the word, nor thinke of it any more. Neither can he take it by violence, without their li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king, that heard it: but with their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, he taketh it onely from them who were careles hearers, who neuer ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red it to ſinke deepe into their hearts; but being like to the high way ſide, did
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:17428:29"/>not couer it with the moyſt mouldes of holy affections: yea he taketh it from thoſe who neuer had any great loue vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to it, and therefore might eafily be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded to let him take it.</p>
               <p>In regard of this his practiſe, Chriſt in the propounding of the parable, compared him to the fowles of the ayre, becauſe as they will follow the ſower, and will picke vp that, which lyes by the high way ſide, or any other place vncouered: ſo the diuell haun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth the aſſemblies, where the word is preached, that he may take from the hearers, that which hath bene taught.

               <p>See then what an enemie the diuell is, to hinder the efficacie of Gods word in mans heart.</p>
               <p>As the preacher laboureth to caſt the word into the heart, ſo he to take it out. He thruſteth many euill things into the heart, he put treaſon into the heart of <hi>Iudas,</hi> to betray Chriſt:<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Iob.</hi> 13.2. <hi>Act.</hi> 5.3.</note> he fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the heart of <hi>Ananias,</hi> to lye vnto the holy Ghoſt. So alſo doth he keepe all manner of good from the heart, by the one he would make vs bad; by the other, he would hinder vs from being good.</p>
               <p>Except it be inpraying, hee doth not trouble a man ſo much in any bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſines, as in hearing of Gods word, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he is afraide leſt man ſhould be conuerted and ſaued thereby.</p>
               <pb n="39" facs="tcp:17428:30"/>
               <p> This his practiſe is euidently ſeene in many. It appeareth by the euent, that he taketh the word from many of our hearers, for when the people haue heard the preacher ſpeake a whole houre together, and deliuer many profitable points of doctrine, and that very plainely, yet few can repeate any thing at all: many will ſay they like him well, he is a good man, and made a very good ſermon, yet cannot tell one word that he ſpake. What is the reaſon hereof? the diuell hath taken it out of their hearts and heads.</p>
               <p>Report to them an humane hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, tell them ſome ſtrange newes, or a tale for their worldly profit, or corporall health, they will keepe it well enough, and at any time, and in any company will relate it very readily: but teach them a myſterie of ſaluation, inſtruct them in a du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie to God or man, they forget it as ſoone as they haue heard it: What is the cauſe hereof but this? the diuell knowes that the one will neuer profit their ſoules, nor further their ſalua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and therefore he will not take it
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:17428:31"/>from them: he is afraid leſt the other ſhould profit their ſoules, and further their ſaluation, and therfore he labours to depriue them of it.</p>
               <p>If a man put coyne in a cheſt, and wares in a chamber, and within a while come and finde none there, he will ſay, a thiefe hath bene there. So if people heare much, and keepe little or no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, it is certaine the diuell hath bene there, to ſteale it out of their hearts.</p>
               <p>This ſhould teach euery one of vs that be hearers, to looke well to our ſelues, and carefully to keep that which we haue heard. The diuell will doe what he can to depriue vs of it. If he cannot keepe thee from heaving, he will (if he can) rob thee of that which thou haſt heard. If thou be careleſſe in keeping, he will be ſure to take all from thee. You knowe, that if a man haue ſome ſpeciall goods, and looke negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently vnto them, and care not much whether he keepe them or looſe them, and a cunning thiefe be very deſirous of them, he is like within a while to get them.</p>
               <pb n="41" facs="tcp:17428:31"/>
               <p> Wherefore,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Gen.</hi> 15.11.</note> as <hi>Abraham</hi> droue away the Fowles that trouble him, when he was ſacrifiſing; ſo driue yee away the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uell, who troubleth you whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> you heare. Euen as you chaſe away the birds that would eate vp the corne ſowne in your fields: And as by harrowing of your ſowne fieldes, you couer the ſeed with earth, that ſo the Fowles may not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoure it, and that it may better fructify: So couer the ſeede of the worde in the furrowes of thy affections, and let it enter deepe into thy heart, and ſo ſhall it both be ſafe from the Diuell, and fit to yeeld fruit in thy life.</p>
               <p>This practiſe of the Diuel is amplified by the ends of it, which are two, the one ſubordinate to the other. The for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer is, leaſt they ſhoulde beleeue. Whence we may obſerue two things; one in reſpect of the word; and another in reſpect of the Diuell.</p>
               <p n="1">1. In reſpect of the word: namely, that the hearing and receiuing of the word, is a ſpeciall meane to bring men to faith: for the Diuell doth therefore hinder men in hearing, leaſt by hearing they ſhould belecue. Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ſayth,
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:17428:32"/>
                  <hi>That faith is by hearing,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.17.</note> 
                  <hi>and hearing by the word of God.</hi> How can they beleeue in him, of whom they haue not heard? and and how can they heare without a Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher? And thoſe for whom Chriſt pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Ioh.</hi> 17.20.</note> muſt beleeue in him, through the Apoſtles word.<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Act.</hi> 8.37.</note> Was not the Eunuch brought to faith by <hi>Philips</hi> teaching? Did not <hi>Cornelius</hi> beleeue by <hi>Peters</hi> preaching?<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Act.</hi> 10.</note> Did not the Iaylor beleeue by hearing of <hi>Paul?</hi>

Thoſe then that deſire faith, muſt heare and receiue the worde. Thoſe that may heare and will not, cannot beleeue. Wofull is their caſe who heare not at all: for whence can they haue faith, if they heare not? Feareful is their caſe who hear ſeldome: they haue no faith, or a weake faith. But happie are they who heare often and well;<note place="margin">August. epist. <hi>105.</hi>
                  </note> they beleeue, and ſhall be ſaued.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Another thing is to be obſerued in reſpect of the Diuell; namely, what an enemie he is vnto faith: for he takes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way the word, as it is entring into mens hearts, leſt they ſhould beleeue. This is
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:17428:32"/>the very cauſe why he is ſo buſy in hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering the worde; becauſe hee would keepe men from faith. And no maruell though he be a deadly enemie vnto faith:<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Heb.</hi> 4.</note> he knowes that the word will not profite the hearers, vnleſſe it be mixed with faith.<note place="margin">

And therefore wil ſeeke to keep this weapon out of our hands, leſt himſelfe &amp; his champion be foiled ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with. We may now ſay with the Apoſtle,<note place="margin">2. <hi>Theſ.</hi> 3.2.</note> 
                  <hi>All men haue not faith.</hi> And no maruell,
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:17428:33"/>ſeeing the Diuell is a ſpightfull foe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt it, and will hinder as many from faith as poſſibly he can. At the end of the world (as Chriſt fore-told) <hi>the ſon of man</hi> ſhall ſcarce find faith on the earth:<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Luk.</hi> 18.8</note> Let it not ſeeme ſtrange: for, as at all other times, ſo then eſpecially will he keepe men backe from faith, his wrath ſhall then be great,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Reuel.</hi> 12.12.</note> becauſe hee ſhall know his time is ſhort.</p>
               <p>Doe not therefore imagine that it is an eaſie thing to get faith, and that thou canſt beleeue when thou liſt; thou canſt not haue faith, but in deſpight of the Diuell; ſo long as he can hinder thee by any meanes, thou ſhalt not beleeue. The Lord muſt enable thee to fruſtrate his attempts, and muſt beſtow this gift on thee againſt his will; otherwiſe thou canſt neuer receiue it.</p>
               <p>But the more he labours to keepe vs from faith, the more earneſtly ſhould we labour to obteyne it. the more he hateth it, the better ſhould we loue it: If it were not a moſt excellent grace, he would not hinder vs of it.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The other end why hee taketh a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way the word is this; Leſt they ſhould
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:17428:33"/>be ſaued: Where alſo two other like things may be conſidered: one in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of the word and faith; another in reſpect of the Diuell.</p>
               <p n="1">1. In reſpect of faith and the word, that they will bring men to ſaluation: For, whereas Chriſt ſaith, the Diuell takes the word out of mens hearts, leſt they ſhould beleue &amp; be ſaued: he ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by inſinuateth, that if the word enter into the heart, do there abide, &amp; worke faith in it, the man ſhall be ſaued. And ſo he ſhall indeed: For the Goſpell (as <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith) is <hi>the power of God vnto ſalua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to euery one that beleeueth:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">

                  <note place="margin">1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.21.</note> And it <hi>plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed God, by the fooliſhnes of preaching to ſaue them that beleeue.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Ioh.</hi> 20.31.</note> And therefore the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vangeliſt ſaith; Theſe things are writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten that yee might beleeue, and in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeuing haue life through his Name. The word bringeth vs to faith, and faith to life euerlaſting. If we get the one, we cannot fayle of the other.</p>
               <p>Oh what an heauenly comfort is this to a beleeuing ſoule! Cannot the Diuel by all his practiſes and pollicies, hinder the worde from working faith in thy
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:17428:34"/>heart? feare him not, he cannot poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly hinder thee of eternall ſaluation in heauen. Looke what aſſurance thou haſt of thy preſent faith, the ſame aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance mayſt thou haue of the future ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation of thy ſoule. If thou now be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue, thou ſhalt receiue the <hi>end of thy faith,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1. <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.9.</note> 
                  <hi>which is the ſaluation of thy ſoule.</hi> But if Sathan ſo take the worde from thee, that thou doſt not beleeue, neuer looke for ſaluation in heauen. Onely he that beleeueth ſhall be ſaued.</p>
               <p n="2">2. In reſpect of the Diuell, hee is an vtter enemy to the ſaluation of mens ſoules; he taketh away the word, and hindereth them from faith, that ſo hee may preuent their ſaluation. This is the end of both the former.</p>
               <p>The Diuell is enuious; vnwilling he is that any of vs ſhould enioy that glory in heauen which he hath loſt. As hee droue <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eue</hi> out of the earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Paradiſe; ſo doth he, what lyeth in him, to keepe vs from the heauenly Paradiſe.

               <p>As the <hi>Ammonites, Moabites, Ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lekites,</hi>
                  <pb n="47" facs="tcp:17428:34"/>and many other heathen people, would haue hindered the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> from entering into the land of Canaan: So the Diuel &amp; all his Angels ſeeke to hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der vs from the Kingdome of heauen. And as the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> ſubdued them, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they could get poſſeſsion: So muſt wee, through the mightie power of Chriſt, ſubdue the Diuell, before wee can enioy that moſt happy and glorious Kingdome.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, to conclude all the poynts touching theſe hearers: See what ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent things they loſe, who ſuffer the Diuell to take the worde out of their hearts: They looſe faith, which is much more precious then gold; as Saint <hi>Peter</hi> ſaith. And hereafter they ſhall loſe the ſaluation of their ſoules;<note place="margin">I. <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.7.</note> which is more worth then all the world. For as CHRIST ſayeth; What aduantageth it a man to winne the whole world, and loſe his owne ſoule?<note place="margin">

               </p>
               <p>You may thinke it little danger to ſuffer the Diuell to take the worde out of your heartes. And it may be ſome had rather haue it taken from them, then the leaſt parte of their
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:17428:35"/>worldly riches: but know that it is a precious Iewell. If you keepe it, you retaine all grace and happineſſe with it: If you leaue it, you loſe all goodnes with it. Oh then when you haue heard it, make much of it, and keepe it ſafely, and be content rather to loſe any thing, yea all things that you haue, then loſe it. If you did truely know, and would duely conſider the danger of this loſſe, you would be more carefull to keepe the word, and more afrayde of loſing it. You, who haue Deedes of your Lands, and Leaſes of your houſes, are very carefull to keepe them ſafely, you will keepe them vnder locke and key, and that in the ſafeſt place of your houſes, becauſe you hold your lands &amp; liuings by them, and may loſe your lands and liuings, if you loſe them. As carefull ſhould you be to keepe the word; you hold your inheritance by it: It is your euidence: If it be taken from you, you ſhall loſe faith and Gods fauour in this world, and the happy poſſeſſion of an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerlaſting and glorious Kingdome in the world to come.</p>

               <p>Now followeth the expoſition of the ſecond kind of ground: to wit, the roc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kie and ſtonie ground. Chriſt declareth who are meant thereby; euen another ſort of vnprofitable heaters. And that he might the better lay open their na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and condition, and let all men ſee who they are, he deſcribeth them at large, by 4. ſcuerall properties. 1.

But theſe are not blamed for that fault; they vnderſtood it well: and therefore are ſayde to receiue it: their receiuing of it, is made a diſtinct thing from their hearing. Again, the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther loſt it as ſoone as they heard it: the Diuel ſoon took it from them; but theſe keepe it a great while, euen all the time of peace, they doe not renounce it, till they be preſecuted for it.

               <p>Laſtly, thoſe did not ſo beleeue as theſe doe: either they did not belecue it at all, or with an hyſtoricall faith one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, beleeue it to be true; but not making ſuch profeſſion of it, nor yeelding ſuch outward obedience to it as theſe doe: as afterward ſhall be ſhewed.</p>

                  <item>4. Laſtly, their ioy differeth in the countinance. The vnregenerate man reioyceth much at the firſt hearing and vnderſtanding of the Goſpell: after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward his ioy abateth.

And as Iewes well haue reioyced in <hi>Iohn Baptiſts</hi> doctrine,<note place="margin">

               </list>
               <p>But the ioy of the regenerate con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinueth alwaies one and the ſame. In proceſſe of time, it rather encreaſeth then decreaſeth. Their faith groweth ſtrong, their hope more ſtedfaſt, their outward man decayeth, their inward man is renewed daily: their graces in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe, and they continually find more experience of Gods fauour toward
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:17428:40"/>them in Chriſt, and therefore their ioy muſt needs be greater and greater. The ioy of the vnregenerate is like to a vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent motion, which is ſwifter at the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning then at the end: but the ioy of the regenerate, is like to a naturall mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which is as ſwift or ſwifter at the end then at the beginning.</p>

               <pb n="49" facs="tcp:17428:41"/>
               <p> But it is not ſo with the vnregene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate hypocrites. A little perſecution for the Goſpell, will turne their ioy into ſorrow. Euen theſe hearers who in the beginning of this verſe, are ſaid to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue the word with ioy; in the latter end of it, are ſaid in the time of tenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to fall away. Seeing then there is ſuch difference of ioy, doe not content your ſelues with ſuch a ioy as may be found in the vnregenerate, but ſecke for ſuch ioy as is peculiar to Gods Saints.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The ſecond properties in theſe hearers is this, <hi>they haue no rootes.</hi> Not as if they had no rootes at all, for then they ſhould not grow at all: they could not be ſaid to fall away in time of ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, they would preſently wither a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way before tentation did come: but the meaning is, that they haue no deepe rootes, they haue no ſuch rootes as will ſeede them, and make them able to yeeld fruit: therfore are they reſembled to rockie and ſtony ground which lac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth moyſture, and will neither ſuffer corne ſowne in it, to take any deepe rooting, nor to proſper long. Rockes
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:17428:41"/>and great ſtones are oftentimes hid in the ground, and couered ouer with earth: And therefore the land there, is ſoft and moyſt aboue, but hard and dry belowe. And the corne ſowne there, may ſprout and growe for a while, but not long, if heate &amp; drought doe come, it will be parched and wither away for lacke of moyſture. Such is the caſe of ſome hearers, their hearts being mollified in part ſomewhat ſoft aboue, but very hard below toward the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tome, will not ſuffer the word to take any deepe rooting in them. It may en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter into their harts, yet it cannot pearce into the bottome of them. It may be ſome rooting, yet very ebbe and ſhal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low. It may proſper for a while, and they make ſome profeſſion of it, yet not long. And in regard hereof, they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come vnprofitable hearers. So as from hence we may obſerue a double dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger and inconuenience, of an heart that is not throughly mollified to the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tome: It both hindereth the rooting of the word, and alſo the fruitfulnes of it.</p>
               <p n="1">1. It hindereth the rooting of the word, ſo as it cannot poſſibly go deepe
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:17428:42"/>enough, the word ſhould deſcend to the bottome of the heart, and there take rooting, and be continually nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhed with the moyſture of it; but it cannot deſcend ſo farre, vnles it be throughly mollified. Not onely they whoſe hearts are altogether hard, as was the hart of <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> when he heard <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Aaron;</hi> and the Scribes and Phariſes when they heard Chriſt: but alſo they whoſe hearts are ſoftened onely in part, are vnprofitable hearers: As not onely thoſe rockes which be bare on the top, and altogether hard, and haue no manner of foyle and moy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture aboue, but likewiſe thoſe which be couered with a litle moyſture and earth aboue, but not much, are vnfit to receiue ſeede. The one will not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue the ſeede at all, nor ſuffer it to ſprout, or ſhoote forth a blade; the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther will cauſe it to ſproute and ſhoote forth a blade, but neuer to beare a ripe eare.</p>
               <p>So they who haue hearts altogether hardened, will not heare, or at leaſt not receiue the word of God at all into any part of their hearts, but thoſe who haue hearts partly ſoft, and partly hard,
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:17428:42"/>may receiue the word, and retaine it for a time, but will neuer bring forth the fruites of it. Wherefore the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ghoſt ſaith in the Pſalmes, and it is applyed by the Apoſtle,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Pſal.</hi> 95.7.8.</note> to the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers of the Goſpell, <hi>To day if ye will heare his voyce, harden not your hearts.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Heb.</hi> 3.7.</note> Becauſe the hard hearted can neuer he are the word of God, ſo reuerently and ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectually as they ought to doe: the Lord biddeth vs not to harden, but to ſoften our hearts, if we will heare his voyce. The harder the heart is, the more vnprofitable ſhall be the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring: the ſofter the heart is, the more profitable ſhall the hearing be.</p>
               <p>Againe, this hardnes will cauſe men to deny the word in time of ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation. The moyſture and ſoftnes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue, is the cauſe of receiuing the word with ioy, and beleeuing for a time: but the hardnes and drineſie below, is the cauſe of reuolting afterward.</p>
               <p>When Gods hand was heauie on <hi>Pharoh,</hi> he ſomewhat relented, hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled himſelfe, and confeſſed his ſinne, but as ſoone as it was remoued, here-turned with the dogge to his vomit, and became as obſtinate as euer he was
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:17428:43"/>before. So if a mans heart be mollified onely in part, he may relent while he heares the word, and may embrace it with peace, but in time of perſecution, may grow as hard as euer he was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore: euen as yron is ſoft, in ſome mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, while it is in the fire, but becom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth hard againe when it is cold.</p>
               <p>Let vs not therefore content our ſelues with an vpper ſoftening, but ſee that our hearts be ſoftened to the very bottome, that they may melt like waxe at the fire,<note place="margin">2. <hi>King.</hi> 22.19.</note> as good king <hi>Ioſiahs</hi> heart did, when he heard the lawe read. I knowe that none of our hearts are ſo loſt as they ſhould be. But if thou fee-leſt thine owne hardnes, doeſt miſlike it, deſireſt earneſtly that it may be more and more mollified, and doeſt vſe all good meanes for the further mollify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of it: thy heart either is alreadie, or ſhall be within a while, ſo ſoftened, as it may receiue the word profitably to thy ſaluatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.

                     <hi>They haue knowne ſurely that I came out from thee, and haue beleeued that thou haſt ſent me.</hi> Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge is the firſt ſtep and degree to each kinde of faith.

                  <item>3. A third degree is, that he hath a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And as the people of the Iewes, who followed Chriſt from place to place, who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they hard him ſpeak of the bread which co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>meth from hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen,<note place="margin">

Yea moreouer, they which haue this faith, may not onely haue this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire in their hearts, but may alſo expreſſe it by prayer to God Almightie, and by vſing the meanes of ſaluation. They may ſeek to enter in at the ſtraight gate, and ſhall not be able.<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Luk.</hi> 13.24.</note> As Chriſt ſaith many ſhall doe. Herein they go beyond thoſe that haue onely an hyſtoricall faith: for many haue it, yet contemne Chriſt and his merits, neuer ſeeke for ſaluati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on by him, rather feare him then loue him: and with the Diuels, beleeue and tremble. Yet herein they come ſhort of them who haue a iuſtifying faith:
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:17428:49"/>for their deſire is not ſo earneſt, nor ſo conſtant, nor ſo effectuall. Not ſo ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt; for the deſire of the elect is vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and very earneſt: ſet foorth by hungring &amp; thirſting, which are vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and ſtrong appetites in them that haue long wanted meate and drinke: yea, the ſtrongeſt deſires that can be found in man: but theſe men haue a deſire in a leſſer meaſure. Neither is their deſire ſo conſtant: for it comes but by fits, and may ſoone be gone a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, like to lightning, which is a ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den flaſh, and ſoone gone. But the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire of the other, is like the light of the Sunne, which is permanent. Their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire may be quenched, before they haue fully obtayned the thing deſired: but the deſire of the other can neuer be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfyed, till they be aſſured that they haue gotten the thing they wanted. Nor yet is it ſo effectuall in vſing the meanes of ſaluation, with ſuch care, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence, painefulneſſe, and conſtancie.

<pb n="67" facs="tcp:17428:49"/>the meanes, before they haue gotten ſauing grace for their ſoules.</item>
                  <item>4. The fourth degree is this: They may haue an apprehenſion of Chriſt and his benefites, an inward feeling of ſome grace, and a perſwaſion of Gods fauour in Chriſt. So they are ſayde to taſte of the heauenly gift, and to taſte of the good word of God,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Heb.</hi> 6.4.</note> and to be partakers of the holy Ghoſt, as was ſhewed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore. Which wordes muſt needes im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port a particular apprehenſion, and an inward cenſe of ſome good receiued, and ſome fauour expected. As ſome of the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> taſted of the fruites of the Land of Canaan, did thereby perceiue what a good Land it was, and concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued ſome hope of enioying it; and yet neuer enioyed the Land, but periſhed in the wilderneſſe. So theſe beleeuers may haue a taſte of heauenly gifts, and an hope of enioying euerlaſting glory, and yet periſh in the end. And indeed theſe beleeuers could not haue receiued the word with ſuch ioy as was ſpoken of before, vnleſſe they had an appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion of Gods fauour, and ſome ſenſe of grace in their hearts. Yet herein doe
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:17428:50"/>they greatly differ from the regenerate. 1. In the ſeat, and ſo in the ſynceritie of theſe graces; for theſe beleeuers hearts are as ſtony ground, they cannot receiue the worde into the bottome of their hearts, nor ſuffer the rootes of it to goe deepe enough; and ſo their faith &amp; gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces are not rooted in the bottome of the heart, but ſticke in the ſuperficies or vpper part of it. All things in them are ſuperficiall, and they full of hypocriſie. Whereas the iuſtifying faith, and the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing graces of the regenerate, are like a ſolide body, hauing three dimenſions, length, breadth and depth; and do poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſe the deepeſt and loweſt parte of the heart. 2. In the reaſon and ground of this their apprehenſion. And ſo it is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but vaine preſumption: for it is built vpon falſe and miſtaken grounds: they take the ſhadow for the ſubſtance; doe ouerweene their owne graces, and take their faith to be vnfayned, their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance to be ſound, and their regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration to be effectuall: when indeede they are not. And ſo they are like vnto beggers, who in their ſleepe dreame that they are become very rich. 3. In
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:17428:50"/>the meaſure: and therefore their appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion of heauenly things, is compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to taſting, becauſe the heart doth as it were, but with the tip of the tongue, lightly taſte theſe ſpirituall things, and doth not feed on them. Look what dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference there is betwixt Cookes and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers that taſte meat before it be ſerued vp to the table, &amp; the gueſts that eat the ſame at the table: the ſame difference there is betwixt the vngenerate &amp; the regenerate, touching the meaſure of grace which they receiue. Though the regenerate do here receiue but the firſt fruits of the ſpirit, do know in part, and propheſie in part, &amp; beleeue in part, &amp; find no perfection in the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues; yet haue they a greater meaſure then the vnrege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerate. 4. In the ſenſe &amp; iudgement of their want. The one wanteth more, and yet doth leſſe diſcerne his want: like the Angel of <hi>Laodicea,</hi>

                  <item>5. The fift degree of this temporary faith, is outwarde profeſſion of the Goſpell. A man may haue an hyſtoricall or dogmaticall faith,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Ioh.</hi> 12.42.</note> yet neuer make profeſſion of it. As many of the chiefe Ruler, among the Iewe, beleeued in Chriſt; but becauſe of the Pha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

So did <hi>Iudas:</hi> he called Chriſt his Maſter, did follow him, was content to acknowledge him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe to be one of his Apoſtles, and at his ſending, to go abroad to preach the Goſpell. So did <hi>Simon Magus:</hi> he was baptized into the Name of Chriſt, and continued with <hi>Philip</hi> as a Diſciple of Chriſt.<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Mat.</hi> 22.14.</note> And ſo doe all thoſe, who be called, and not choſen.</item>
                  <item>6. The laſt degree of this temporary faith, is outward obedience vnto the Goſpell. This was likewiſe in <hi>Iudas.</hi>
                     <pb n="71" facs="tcp:17428:51"/>His cariage was ſo honeſt among the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles, all the time of Chriſts paſſion, that when Chriſt told them,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Mat.</hi> 26.22.</note> that one of them ſhould betray him, they did not ſuſpect him any more then any of the reſt: yea,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Mar.</hi> 14.19.</note> euery one did as much ſuſpect him ſelfe as <hi>Iudas:</hi> and therefore euery one ſayd; Maſter is it I? Yea,<note place="margin">

And Chriſt did manifeſt him, by giuing him a ſoppe, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they could tell who it was. And ſo this faith doeth farre excell that dead faith, whereof S. <hi>Iames</hi> ſpeaketh, which is deſtitute of good works.<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Iam.</hi> 4.</note> Yet euen in this reſpect is it much inferior to a true iuſtifying faith. In regard of outward obedience, they differ three wayes.

                        <item>1. In the cauſe or fountaine whence it proceedeth. The obedience of the one proceedeth from an heart which hath the corruption of it ſuppreſſed and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrayned, but not mortifyed: and the affections builded, but not changed by regeneration. But the obedience of the other, proceedes from a pure heart and a good conſcience: the corruption whereof is not onely repreſſed and

And this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth to paſſe by reaſon of their owne hardnes, as this parable declareth: for as ſtony grounds mingled with ſome earth, are commonly hotte, and will cauſe the corne caſt into them, to ſprout and come vp very ſpeedily: but will not ſuff;er the rootes to goe any reaſonable depth into the earth, there to be fed with moyſture: therfore in the dry ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of ſummer, the blade of the corne will wither, together with the rootes. So theſe men, though they haue ſome good motions and affections in their harts, &amp; receiue the word with cheare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulnes, and ſeeme to be very forward for a time, yet in time of perſecution, all their goodnes will be dried vp: they will looſe their firſt loue to the word, and fall from their former profeſſion.

               <p>The firſt ſort were hindered in their fruitfulneſſe by the Diuell, who tooke the worde out of their hearts. The ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond ſort were hindered by other men, who perſecuted them for the Goſpell. But this ſort are hindered by their owne carnall and worldly luſtes. They differ from the firſt kind, becauſe thoſe vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood not the word: but theſe vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand it, and would haue embraced and obeyed it, but that it croſſed their cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt affections, which they coulde not brydle. They differ from the ſecond ſort, becauſe they fall away in time of tribulation and perſecution. Theſe fall
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:17428:64"/>away in time of peace and proſperitie: thoſe were vrged by externall meanes, comming from others: theſe are drawne away by internall meanes, proceeding from themſelues. Thoſe were hindered in their perſeuerance and fruitfulneſſe, through the wa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of good: theſe through the hauing of euill, euen ſinfull luſts, and bad affections in their hearts, which like thornes choake the worde which they heare. Thoſe renounced their profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion: theſe keepe their profeſſion, and yet are vnfruitfull. Theſe hearers are not all alike: for though the word be choaked in them all, yet it is not choa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked in all, by the ſame cauſes &amp; meanes. In ſome it is choaked by worldly care: in others by the deceitfulneſſe of riches; and in the reſt by voluptouſneſſe. And therefore touching theſe hearers, wee may obſerue ſome thinges in generall, which concerne them all ioyntly toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and ſome thinges in particular, which concerne them ſeuerally.

As thornie ground may haue ſome good moyſt mouldes, and depth of ſoyle, and cauſe the ſeede ſowne in it to ſprout and come vp, but afterward will not ſuffer it to proſper, the thornes in time will choake it. So may a man heare the word, reuerently and attentiuely, marke it carefully, and receiue it willingly: yea, hee may take it to be the word of God indeede, and the onely word that muſt ſaue his ſoule: hee may wiſh that hee were able to follow it, and haue a purpoſe to follow it: and yet after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warde bee hindered in the obedience of it, by the corruptions of his owne heart.</p>
               <p>As <hi>Pharaoh</hi> was hu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bled while the hand of God was heauy vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> him: but became
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:17428:65"/>as hard as he was before, when it was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moued. And as ſome are Sea ſicke while they are on the water, but wel again who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they come to land. And as the hardeſt Mettals are hot, ſoft, and pliable, while they are in the fire, but become colde, hard, and ſtiffe when they are taken out of the fire. So are ſome hearers much moued while they are in the Church, and ſo long as they heare: and yet after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, when they are gone away, and betake themſelues to their worldly af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fayres, looſe the efficacy of the worde, and become tranſgreſſors of it.</p>
               <p>Theſe are vnprofitable hearers, the worde which they heare will not ſaue their ſoules. Men may often heare after this maner, and yet neuer come to hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen. Doe not therefore content your ſelues with theſe preſent motions, while you are in hearing, but let them conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue, and ſhew their efficacy after you haue heard, &amp; when occaſion is offered in your liues. Let not the word onely moue your affections, but alſo mortifie them. And let it not onely ſtirre vp your affections, while it is hard, but direct them, and ouer-rule them in your con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſation
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:17428:65"/>afterward. Let not any thing in the worlde, or any affections in your owne hearts, hinder your obedience to the worde. You know that the Sonne, who being commaunded by his Father to worke in his Vineyatd,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Mat.</hi> 21.30.31.</note> did promiſe and purpoſe to goe, and went not: was condemned for not fulfilling the will of his Father. And doe you thinke that you ſhall be taken for dutifull children to God Almightie, if while you heare his word, you loue it, and like it, and pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe to follow it: and yet afterward by ſome ſiniſter occaſions, be hindered in the obedience of it?

Worldly cares keepe many from the Church, who would not be abſent if their worldly buſineſſe did not draw them another way: yet will not bee preſent if their abſence ſerue for their gaine.

               <p>Oh conſider, that as the Diuell may deceiue you, and as other men may de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue you, ſo alſo your own wealth may deceiue you, and that as dangerouſly as any.</p>
               <p>It may ſo deceiue you, as it may procure your euerlaſting deſtruction, if in time, you do not eſpie it, and redreſſe it.</p>
               <p>CHRIST would neuer haue ſaid that the deceitfulnes of Riches, as Thornes choake the ſeed of the word, vnleſſe ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches did deceiue men, and make them vnfruitfull hearers. Let his words then be an admonition, to make you take better heede.</p>
               <p>There is not any one of you, but if a Friende tolde you of a Couzener, that had beguyled manie, and went about to deceyue you, to your great dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage, you would take warning, and ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther refuſe to haue any dealings at all with the man, or elſe, if by neceſſity you
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:17428:79"/>were compelled thereunto, you would be ſo very circumſpect in your dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings, that hee ſhould hardly defraud you. Chriſt Ieſus here lets you vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand, that riches are deceitfull, and that in deceiuing men, they hinder them in that which ſerues for Gods glory, and the good of their owne ſoules. And will not you receiue war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, and beware of them? Take heede of them, they ſeeme to be your good friends, and much to pleaſure you, yet is there falſhood in their fellowſhip. The better you like them, the more you loue them: and the more you truſt them, the more readie are they to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue you.</p>
               <p>And indeed this is one of the ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſt and groſſeſt deceits that can be found in the world In other matters men are deceiued againſt their wills, but in this, with their wills. In other things the deceiued, doe of themſelues ſoone eſpie the coſenage, and ſeeke to helpe themſelues: but in this, many are deceiued continually, and yet can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not diſcerne it? yea, if another tell them of it, yet will they not beleeue it.
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:17428:79"/>In other fraudes the deceiuers are moſt in fault; but here the deceiued are in greateſt fault: for riches deceiue you, not through their owne craft, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

As the Fiſherman couereth his hooke with a baite, that the fiſh bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting at the baite, may be catched with the hooke: So the Diuell doeth baite many ſinnes with pleaſure, that man re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiuing the pleaſure, may be catched with the ſinne. In regard whereof, the voluptuous man, who will not bee a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridged of any pleaſure, committeth many ſinnes againſt God, and fayleth often in the obedience of the word. He may often heare the word, yet will not obey it in any point which croſſeth his pleaſure. As ſome ſicke patients are content that the Phyſition pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe them a dyet, and ſometime aske him a queſtion, whether ſuch meate be good for them or no: though the Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition, who beſt knowes what is hurt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full for him, doe forbid them ſome

So men come to heare the worde, and there by to learne what is good and ill for the health of their ſoules: though the Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher giue them good direction, yet ſo earneſt is their deſire of pleaſure, that they will take their delight in thoſe thinges which hee by the worde doeth forbid.</p>

As all the other groundes ſet forth to our view the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and properties of bad hearers; ſo this deſcribeth the conditions of good hearers.</p>

<pb n="142" facs="tcp:17428:98"/>of theſe hearers in particular, we are to obſerue one thing in generall, and from the coherence; to wit, That although Chriſt had diuers ſorts of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers; and nany of them were bad, ſome one way, ſome another way; yet all of them were not bad, ſome were good and profitable hearers: all his ſeed was not loſt; ſome fell on good ground, &amp; yeelded plentifull encreaſe. Though the Scribes and Phariſes, and many of the common multitude were bad hearers; yet the Apoſtles and many other Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples were good hearers, did keepe the word in their hearts, and brought forth fruit in their liues.

                     <hi>Ioh.</hi> 7.40.41.43.46.</note> there was diſſention among his hearers: Some ſayde; Of a truth this is the Prophet. Others ſayd; This is the Chriſt.

               <p>And thus it pleaſeth GOD ſtill to bleſſe the Miniſterie of his ſeruants, Though they cannot conuert all, yet they doe conuert ſome; they doe not altogether loſe their labour.

               <p>But to come neerer to the proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of theſe hearers in particular: In the deſcription of them, and by com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring them with the former hearers, wee may eaſilie perceiue, that in ſome thinges they doe agree with them: in ſome thinges they differ from them, and doe much excell them. There were ſome commendable thinges in diuers of the former hearers,
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:17428:101"/>and would haue wrought good in them if they had beene well vſed. In theſe things doe theſe good hearers agree with them. They haue the ſelfe-ſame things, though in a better maner, and with better vſe.</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. They agree with them, in that they heare as well as the reſt. All the perſons ſpoken of in this Parable are hearers, both good and bad: and they all heare one and the ſame doctrine, though not after one and the ſame ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, nor with the like efficacy and fruit.z And therefore thoſe which refuſe to heare, eyther through error, as our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſants: or through contempt and neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence, as ſome careleſſe and carnall people, are ſo farre from beeing the ground here mentioned, as that they are worſe then the bad ground ſpoken of before. There cannot be any good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe in their hearts, nor yet in their liues. Can any field yeeld a good crop of corne at harueſt, which was not ſowne at the ſeede time? They are worſe then many reprobates haue beene and are: How then can they looke to be as good as the Elect are and ſhall be?</item>
                  <pb n="171" facs="tcp:17428:101"/>
                  <item> 2. They agree in the vnderſtanding of the word: for it is ſayd in <hi>Mathew;</hi> He that receiueth ſeed in good ground,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Mat.</hi> 13.23.</note> is he that heareth the word, and vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtandeth it.<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Mat.</hi> 13.19.</note> And although the firſt ſort of bad hearers are ſayd to heare and not vnderſtand: Yet the other two fortes are inſinuated to haue vnderſtood: for how could they receiue the word with ioy, vnleſſe they vnderſtood it? How could cares of the world, the deceitful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of riches, and voluptuous liuing, choake the word after it was heard, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe it had beene vnderſtood? So that as the vnderſtanding of the word is not ſufficient to make you good hearers: ſo on the other ſide, the want of vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, declareth you to be bad hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers. All good hearers vnderſtand the word, though not onely they. Good hearers muſt practiſe that which is taught them: But how can they prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe that which they vnderſtand not?</item>
                  <item>3. They agree in their affection to the word. Thoſe that be as ſtony grou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d, receiue the worde with ioy. So alſo doe theſe good hearers, though the thing it ſelfe be not expreſly me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tioned.
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:17428:102"/>The Goſpell is glad tydings, and reioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth the hearts of all that embrace it. There is no commendable propertie in the reprobate and vnprofitable hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers, but it is found in the elect and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable hearers, and that in a more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent manner. And therefore thoſe who are nothing mooued nor comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by the word, are worſe then ſome bad hearers, and muſt not be reckoned in the number of good hearers. Not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding, in this deſcription of theſe good hearers, wee may perceiue that in diuers other things, they differ much from all the former hearers, and therein doe greatly exceede and excell them all. They are deſcribed by three properties, and by them all, they differ from the reſt. 1. By the manner of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiuing the word: They receiue it with an honeſt and good heart. 2. By the maner of reteyning it; <hi>They keep it.</hi> 3. By the maner of practiſing it; <hi>They bring forth fruit, and that with patience and plentie.</hi>
                  </item>

               <p>Touching the firſt propertie 2. things may bee noted: The one more gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall; and that is the inſtrument of hearing, it is with the heart. The other
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:17428:102"/>more ſpeciall; and that is the qualitie and diſpoſition of their heart, it is an honeſt and good heart.</p>

               <p>The originall word as ſome haue obſerued, is very emphaticall, and importeth a keeping with much la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour and difficultie.</p>
               <p>And ſo fitly expreſſeth the manner of their keeping, which is with ſtriuing and ſtrugling againſt their owne cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions, againſt Sathans ſuggeſtions, and againſt the world; allurements. Though all conſpire, and ioyne their forces together, yet doe they keepe it ſo ſafe and ſure, as that they cannot wreſt it from them. And herein they alſo differ from all the former hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers.</p>
               <p>The firſt ſort loſt it as ſoone as they receiued it: euen while they were in hearing, the diuell tooke it from them. The ſecond ſort kept it a while, but
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:17428:110"/>not long, for they beleeue for a time, they keepe the word no longer then they kept their faith. Though they kept both in time of peace, yet they loſt both in time of perſecution. The third ſort kept the word, yet not long, when as afterward it was choaked by cares and pleaſures, it was taken from them. But theſe kept it for euer, neither the diuel by his ſuggeſtions, nor other men by their perſecutions, nor their owne luſts by their prouocations, can depriue them of the word. Such an hearer was the bleſſed virgin, the mother of Chriſt, ſhe kept all her Sauiours ſayings in h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And ſuch keepers are all profitable hearers, for if the word enter into mens harts, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward goe out againe, it will doe them little or no good at all.</p>
               <p>Though the meate which a man ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth, be receiued into his ſtomacke, yet vnles it continue there for a time, and be there digeſted, it will not nouriſh and ſeede his body.</p>

And therefore Chriſt ſaid,<note place="margin">

               <list>
                  <item>1. It ſerueth for direction: for the word, kept in the heart, will direct a man in his life, teaching him what ſins to auoyd, what duties to performe. It will be a lanterne vnto his feete, and a light vnto his path. It will be a guide, to ſay vnto him,<note place="margin">

<pb n="190" facs="tcp:17428:111"/>of the word in the heart, were a ſpeciall and an effectuall meane to keepe men from ſinne. And he alſo writeth of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers; The mouth of the righteous will ſpeake of wiſedome,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Pſal.</hi> 37.30.31.</note> and his tongue will talke of iudgement: for the lawe of his God is in his heart, and his ſteps ſhall not ſlide. If you will carefully and ſafely keepe the word in your hearts, you ſhall ſhew forth the fruit of it in your liues.</item>
                  <item>2. It ſerueth for perſeuerance. It will make a man conſtantly to conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue in grace, in obedience, in the Lords fauour, and in ſtate of ſaluation. It is certaine, that ſo long as men keepe the word in their harts, they cannot wholy fall away from God. Now thoſe that heare with good and honeſt hearts, ſhall alwaies ſafely keepe it: neither can the diuells tentations, nor the worlds perſecution rob them of it: neither can their owne corrupt affections being mortified, expell it out of their hearts. Though other hearers may looſe the word by thoſe meanes, yet not any of theſe which haue theſe honeſt &amp; good harts. And therefore as they are now in
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:17428:111"/>grace &amp; in ſtate of ſaluatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, ſo ſhall they continue therein for euer. Whereupon <hi>Iohn</hi> ſayth;<note place="margin">1. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 3.9.</note> 
                     <hi>Whoſoeuer is borne of God, ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth not: for his ſeede remaineth in him: neyther can he ſinne, becauſe he is borne of God.</hi> He cannot ſinne totally and final<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, ſo as he ſhould thereby quite cut off himſelfe from grace, and from ſaluation.</item>
               </list>
               <p>Wherefore this propertie of theſe hearers, confuteth their opinion, who hold, that a man once in ſtate of grace, may vtterly fall away, and become a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probate. If any will obiect, that ſo long as they keepe the word in their hearts, they cannot fall away: but they may looſe the word, it may bee taken out of their hearts, and then they may periſh.</p>
               <p>I anſwere. That in this their argument they begge the queſtion: for neyther can any other take the worde from them, neyther ſhall they loſe it of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues. For this perpetuall keeping of the word, is a ſpeciall propertie in theſe good hearers, whereby they differ from all other hearers. As their heartes are farre better then the reſt; ſo ſhall they better keepe the word then any of the reſt. Thoſe bad hearers, which had their
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:17428:112"/>hearts mollified but in part, or had their hearts fraught with worldly cares and voluptuouſnes, may receiue and keepe the worde for a time, and looſe it after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, as you heard before: but theſe who haue honeſt and good hearts ſhall keepe it, and bring forth fruit. This is a maine difference betwixt them; that the reſt keepe it for a time, theſe keepe it for euer. If theſe hearers might after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward looſe it as well as the reſt, and bring forth no fruites of it, then were there no difference betwixt them and the former. But certainely there is great difference. And therefore thoſe who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue it, and keepe it not long, receiue it with bad hearts. Thoſe who receiue it with good and honeſt hearts, ſhall keepe it vnto the end. In this reſpect Chriſt compared him that heard his words,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Mat.</hi> 7.24.25.</note> and did the ſame, to a wiſe man, which built his houſe on a rocke: the raine fell, the floodes came, and the windes blew, and beat vpon that houſe, and it fell not: for it was founded on a rocke. So firmely is this hearer built on Chriſt, that ſure &amp; immoueable Rocke, that no troubles, tryals, perſecutions, or

But euen becauſe they haue neglected theſe meanes. Vſe them hereafter, and you ſhall finde how well they will make you able to keepe that which you heare.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And bring forth fruite.</hi> The third and laſt propertie in theſe hearers is this; They bring forth fruite. And this is another ſpeciall difference betwixt them and all the reſt: For the reſt, ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther bring forth no fruite at all, as the firſt ſorte; or but for a time, as the ſecond: or imperfect fruite, and
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:17428:116"/>in ſome things onely, as the third. But theſe bring forth not for a while, but continually; not in ſome thinges onely, but in all; and that ripe and perfect fruite. If good ſeede bee ſowne in good ground, it vſually bringeth forth fruite for the vſe of them which owe it and ſowe it: So if ſome doctrine be preached, and people heare it with good heartes, it will bring forth fruit in their liues.</p>
               <p>Theſe fruites are brought forth, not by profeſſion, but by practiſe; and doe conſift not ſo much in wordes as in deedes. And therefore <hi>Paul</hi> prayed that the <hi>Philippians</hi> might be filled with the fruites of righteouſneſſe.<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Phil.</hi> 1.11.</note> And that the <hi>Coloſſians</hi> might pleaſe God in all things,<note place="margin">

                  </gap>, but of the obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience which they performe on earth: for that is a fruit which they receiue;
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:17428:117"/>this is a fruite which they bring forth: That they receiue from God, this they yeeld vnto God: that is a fruit of glory, this is a fruit of grace.</p>
               <p>See then the diſpoſition of theſe good hearers: They doe not onely heare the word with their cares, and vnderſtand it with their mindes, and keep it in their hearts; but they doe alſo practiſe it in their liues. This is the chiefeſt end of all the reſt. Therefore doe they heare it, and learne it, and keep it in their hearts, that they may order their liues by it, and practiſe it when occaſion is offered. Happy are all thoſe which thus heare. For as <hi>Iames</hi> ſaith;<note place="margin">

               <p>If therefore you would haue your hearing to be acceptable to God, and comfortable to your owne ſoules, let it end in obedience.

               <p>But take heede, leaſt you bee decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued in iudgeing amiſſe of theſe fruites; for ſome haue erred in taking thoſe to be good fruites, which are none: and thoſe to be none, which are.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Theſe fruites come of the ſeed, and bee of the ſame kinde and nature with the ſeede. As nothing is good ſeede but the worde of God: ſo no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing is to bee taken for good fruit, but the practiſe and obedience of the worde. And therefore the actes of will-worſhippe, the obſeruations of vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>written traditions, and the practiſe of mens precepts, are not the fruits here ſpoken of. The Lord may ſay to them that bring foorth ſuch fruite; Who required theſe thinges at your handes? Theſe things, as the Apoſtle ſaith,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Col.</hi> 2.23.</note> may haue a ſhew of wiſedome in voluntarie Religion, and humbleneſſe of minde, and in not ſparing the bodie, nor ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing it in eſtimation to ſatisfie the fleſh;
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:17428:119"/>yet they periſh with the vſe: they are after the comandements and doctrines of men, and therefore cannot pleaſe the Lord. God requires, that you, who haue beene taught the worde, ſhould bring forth the fruites of it, and not the fruites of humane traditions. If a man ſow his fielde with corne, and it bring forth more graſſe then corne, it will not content him, the graſſe would haue growne there, though it neuer had beene ſowne with corne. In like ſort, if you be taught the word of God, and be more carefull to obſerue mans traditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Gods truth, you ſhall not pleaſe the Lord therby, but rather offend him.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Againe, as ſome haue erred in ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king thoſe to be fruits which are not, ſo on the other hand, ſome haue erred in taking thoſe to be no fruits, which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed are good fruits. Know you, that the practiſe of euery dutie comanded in the word, is good fruit. Notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, as there be diuers kinds of ſeede, ſome of one graine, ſome of another, &amp; alſo diuers kindes of fruits, ſome of one graine, ſome of another: So there be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners kinds of doctrines, &amp; diuers kinds
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:17428:119"/>of duties. And as al fields are not ſowne with the ſame graine, but ſome with one kinde, ſome with another, as they will beſt beare. So all doctrines and duties are not impoſed and enioyned to all perſons, but ſome to one, ſome to another, according to their calling, place and eſtate. And therefore as all fields doe not bring forth the ſame graine, but euery one that kind where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with it was ſowne: So all perſons can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not performe the ſame duties, but ſome one kinde, ſome another, according to their eſtate and calling. The Magiſtrate therefore bringeth forth one kind of fruite, the miniſter another, the people another. The father one kind, the child another, the Maiſter one kind, the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uant another: The rich one kind, the poore another. Yet as that is accounted a fruitfull field, which bringeth forth a plentiful encreaſe of that graine where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with it was ſowne, though it be not the leaſt graine of all. So thoſe perſons are fruitfull hearers, who carefully per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme all ſuch duties as belong to their place, ſtate and calling, though they be not able to performe ſuch good
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:17428:120"/>workes, as are accounted the greateſt and moſt profitable.</p>
               <p>Some haue imagined that the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of Colledges and Schooles, erec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of Hoſpitals, building of Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, bountifull almes giuen to the poore, and ſuch great good workes, which can be performed by a fewe, are the onely or chiefeſt good fruites. Though we will not denie but that theſe be excellent fruits in their kinde, if they proceede from a good roote, and be directed to a right end, yet are there many other good fruites, that may be as acceptable to God, and as comfortable to the doers. Not onely the common duties of all Chriſtians, but likewiſe the particular duties of euery mans ſpeciall calling and eſtate, (though it be neuer ſo meane and baſe in the iudgement of the world) if they be performed in ſuch a ſort as the word directeth, are moſt acceptable fruites: ſuch as God will approue and reward. He that is a ſeruant, and in his ſeruice is put to many baſe workes: yet if he performe the common duties of all Chriſtians, and likewiſe performe
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:17428:120"/>the workes of his calling, in ſuch a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner as the word teacheth him, the worke of his ſeruice, are good fruits. And therefore <hi>Paul</hi> bad ſeruants be obedient to their Maiſters in ſinglenes of heart,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 6.5.</note> as vnto Chriſt: not with eye ſeruice, as men pleaſers, but as the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants of Chriſt, doing the will of God from the heart. As if by ſeruing their Maiſters, in a good ſort, they did ſerue Chriſt: yea he lets them vnderſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d, that God would reward that their ſeruice: for whatſoeuer good thing any man doth, that ſhall he receiue of the Lord,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Verſ.</hi> 8.2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 8.12.</note> whether he be bond or free. And elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where the Apoſtle teacheth, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> if there be firſt a willing minde, it is accepted according to that a man hath, and not according to that he hath not. This bringeth forth of fruite is amplified 2. waies: 1. by y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> maner, 2. by the meaſure of it. Firſt by y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> maner of it, for they are ſaid to bring forth fruit with patience. And herein may alſo be ſeen a differe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce betwixt theſe, and one ſort of the other hearers: Thoſe that be co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pared to ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny grou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d, in time of tentation fal away, &amp; ſo fayle both in profeſſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> &amp; practiſe;
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:17428:121"/>and the reaſon is, becauſe they want pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience to beare the croſſes that doe follow the word. But theſe at all ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons and in all eſtates, continue con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant both in their profeſſion and prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe, becauſe they be endued with pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience, to endure all troubles that doe befall them for the words ſake. After ground is ſowne with corne, it endures many violent ſtormes, and intemperate ſeaſons: faire weather and fowle, froſt and ſnowe, cold and raine in winter, heate and drought in ſummer, before it can beare fruit in harueſt. So thoſe who heare and receiue the word, for the ſaluation of their ſoules, doe often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times endure great troubles, and ſuffer much affliction, before they can bring forth the fruits of it. Yet if they be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued with patience, they will be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to beare all. Hence it is, that the Apoſtle telleth the Hebrewes,<note place="margin">

               <p n="1">1. For firſt it is apparant that Chriſt ſpake it not of receiuing fruits, or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards: but of bearing and bringing forth the fruits of obedience.</p>
               <p>Though theſe be ſo linked together, as the one ſort doth certainely follow the other, yet doe they much differ. The one ſort of fruits are our deeds, performed by vs vnto God: the other ſort are Gods rewards, which hee in mercy beſtoweth on vs, and which we receiue from him.</p>
               <p>The one ſort are the fruits of grace, here brought-forth for a time on the earth, the other are the fruits of glory, receiued and enioyed in heauen, for euermore.</p>
               <p>Of the former kind, Chriſt ſpeaketh:
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:17428:125"/>For it was not his purpoſe to ſhew the difference betwixt men in heauen; but a difference betwixt good hearers, in bringing forth the fruits of the word on the earth. Euen as before he noted a difference betwixt bad hearers, not as they ſhall be hereafter in hell, but as they are now liuing in the world: how then can his words proue any merit of workes, or difference of me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits in the next life?</p>
               <p n="2">2. Chriſt in this parable ſpake not of any outward eſtates, or different degrees of men in the world, but onely of diuers ſorts of hearers. Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of all eſtates and conditions, did then heare him, and afterward heare the Apoſtles, and doe now heare vs. Now Chriſt teacheth, that of what ſtate or condition ſoeuer they be, whether ſingle perſons, or maried, or widowes, they ſhall beare fruites, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the manner of their hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, and according to the inward diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition of their hearts.</p>
               <p>And therefore a maried perſon hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring in a better manner, and recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing the word with a better heart, then
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:17428:126"/>a virgine, then a widowe, ſhall bring forth more fruites of the word, and receiue more benefite by his hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring.</p>

<pb n="221" facs="tcp:17428:126"/>are here taught, that many may heare the word of God together, and all be profitable hearers, and all be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued by their hearing, yet all doe not profit alike, nor bring forth the ſame fruites of obedience in their liues: but ſome fewer, ſome more; accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding as their hearts are prepared, and according as it pleaſeth the Lord to beſtowe his graces. Yea though they all heare one and the ſame man, and the ſame ſermons, and one heare as often as another: yet may one be more plentifull in the fruites of the word, then is another.</p>
               <p>All furrowes of the ſame land, doe not bring forth an equall number of eares: and all eares of the ſame fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowe, doe not beare an equall num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of graines: but ſome more, ſome leſſe, as it pleaſeth the Lord to giue an encreaſe.</p>

               <p>If their hearts be holy and good, if they doe all of faith and ſinceritie, and deſire to bring forth more fruits: God will account them profitable hearers, and accept of their obedience. And the word which they heare, ſhall ſaue their ſoules.</p>

               <p>Such is his mercy and bountie, that although hee require the ſame meaſure of all, yet finding difference among them, becauſe of the diuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitie of his grace, he doth ſo receiue

            <p>In regard whereof, I may iuſtly feare your ſharpe and bitter cenſures of theſe my Sermons, now put foorth to open ſight: I can expect no more indifferen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie and fauour at your hands, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> others my betters haue formerly found.

So abſurd is this his obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation, ſo voyde of reaſon, ſo deſtitute of proofe, and ſo diſcrepant from the doctrine of his owne Church, that it may well bee thought, that rather ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice againſt vs, then any warrant from the text, cauſed him to ſet it downe.

               <p>Firſt, they differ in their obiects and actes. The one layeth hold of Gods promiſes &amp; mercies in Chriſt, as hath bene formerly proued, but this hath the power of God for the obiect, for by it a man beleeueth, that God by his ſpeciall power will enable him to worke a miracle.

               <pb n="283" facs="tcp:17428:167"/>
               <p> Againe, a iuſtifying faith is an or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary grace beſtowed on men in all ages: for there alwaies were, now are, and alwayes ſhal be ſome endu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with it. The Church alwaies hath beene, and euer ſhal continue, to the end of the world. And it conſiſteth of a number of true beleeuers.</p>

                  </note> that this gift was needfull at the firſt preaching of the Goſpell, and the firſt planting of the

Euen as at the firſt ſetting and planting of a tree, watering is needfull, but not af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward, when it hath taken deepe rooting. Now, can an extraordinary gift be the ſame with a common and ordinary? Can an extraordinary gift, long agoe ceaſed, be a degree of an ordinary gift, ſtill continuing in the Church?</p>
               <p>Moreouer, theyr difference may bee ſeene, in reſpect of the perſons who receiue them. The Iuſtifying faith is proper onely to the elect, and to the Saintes of God, as before hath bene proued. Yet they may want this miraculous faith. A man may bee in ſtate of grace, and yet want it. As appeareth by the examples of Gods Saintes in all ages, who were iuſtified by faith, and yet were not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to worke miracles.</p>

               <p>But they muſt knowe, that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though the Apoſtle compare a dead faith not to a dead man, but to a dead body, yet he compareth it to
<pb n="310" facs="tcp:17428:181"/>the dead body of a man, which is no true humane body indeed, becauſe it wanteth the ſoule which is the forme of it. The Philoſopher will teach them; That when the bodye is dead, there is neyther foote nor hand, but onely by equiuocation, for all the parts of the body, are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined by their office and facultie, therefore when they lye dead, they are not the ſame, but onely retaine the ſhadow and ſhew of the name. Though a dead body haue the earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and materiall parts, yet it is not the true body of a man, nor the ſame body that it was before, ſeeing it wanteth his forme, life, and actiuitie, operation and motion. So a dead faith hath ſome materiall parts of a true faith, as knowledge, vnderſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, and aſſent: yet it is not a true faith indeed, becauſe it wanteth ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall application, which is the ſoule of ſaith.

Who would be ledde by ſuch guydes? I knowe that they would make a difference betwixt the faith of their right Catholickes, and the faith of diuels: becauſe the one hath Charitie alwayes accompanying it, the other wanteth Charity. But they might conſider, that according to their doctrine, this maketh no eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiall, but a meere accidentall diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence.

               <p> I know that the Fathers do ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time note loue, as a difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the faith of Chriſtians and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uels, and betwixt the faith of good Chriſtians and bad. Yet do they not make it the onely difference betwixt them: they teach an eſſentiall diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce by belieuing in God with truſt and confidence. Againe, they might better make it a difference of theyr faith, then the Papiſts can make it a difference of the faith which they teach, becauſe it was a neceſſary and proper effect, proceeding from that their faith, &amp; not from any other. For thoſe that do ſo belieue in God with hope and confidence, of his mercie and goodnes towards them, cannot but loue him. But papiſts haue no ſuch confidence nor aſſura<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce in their faith, which ſhould make them to loue God, they may haue all theyr faith without loue. And therefore loue cannot diſtinguiſh it eſſentially from the faith of diuels.</p>
               <p>So then, to ſhut vp this point, it ſtill remaineth apparent, that in the nature and ſubſtance, there is no dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
<pb n="318" facs="tcp:17428:185"/>at all betwixt popiſh aſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting faith, and the faith of diuels. And ſurely thoſe that now content themſelues with ſuch a faith, as is no better in ſubſtance then the faith of diuels, may iuſtly feare, leaſt hereaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, they ſhall haue no better eſtate in ſubſtance then the deuils haue.</p>

There is a dead faith, a fained faith, and a tried faith. The dead faith the Apoſtle defineth to be a faith with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out workes, which doth not worke by loue. The fained faith (ſaith he) I thinke that is called, which hauing receiued life from charitie, begins to be moued to worke well: but not

In the ſame ſenſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed I may call it fained or faſhio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, that we call the potters veſſels <hi>fictilia non</hi> becauſe they are not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficable ſo long as they laſt: but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe, ſeeing they are brickle, they doe not laſt long.

When, and whither doe they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part? ſurely from faith to infidelitie. And theſe (ſaith Chriſt) haue no rootes.

Such are the ſoules, hauing as yet a little and tender charitie, and for this cauſe, their faith though liuely, yet fained (or fraile) muſt needes faile in tentation. What kinde of faith euery mans is, tribulation doth try. If any man faile, it is knowne to be fained. If any mans continue, it is iudged to be a tried and a perfect faith. &amp;c.

For in the time of ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation they goe away: Which faith, becauſe it hath no rootes, the holie Scripture doth not call a true faith. And that faith which doth not bring forth the fruite of glorie, is no faith before Chriſt.</p>
               <p>In this reſpect, the reprobate are accuſed of vnbeliefe. Becauſe, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though they ſeemed in outward ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance to belieue, yet they did not truely belieue: becauſe they wanted eyther true Charitie, or Conſtancie, which is ſo annexed to true faith, that in Scripture, faith is taken for fidelitie, and that hee proueth by the wordes of the Apoſtle, 1. <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.6.</p>
               <p>Theſe wordes and many more to the ſame effect, are related by <hi>Sixtus Senenſis,</hi> yet not confuted, nor con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned: and therefore ſeeme to be approued. Doe not you therefore condemne me for teaching the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porary faith, to be another faith then iuſtifying faith is.</p>
               <p>Thus I hope you plainely ſee, that
<pb n="323" facs="tcp:17428:187"/>there is not one only faith in all men, as ſome of your teachers would bear you in hand; but that there be diuers kindes of faith, really diſtinct one from another, in nature, in degrees, in efficacy and operation. And that this hath beene the ancient doctrine of the true Church, and ſtill hath bene taught by ſome in the Romane Church. I pray God that you may not deceiue your ſelues with a fained faith, nor content your ſelues with that aſſenting faith, which ſome doe falſely tell you is ſufficient. But that you may ſeeke and alſo obtaine that iuſtifying faith, which is able to ſaue your ſoules.</p>
               <p>Take heede of giuing too much credite to ſome late popiſh writers. Their malice againſt vs, prouoketh them to ſpeake worſe of faith then they ought. Though it be the moſt neceſſary and moſt effectuall grace, which God here beſtoweth on man, yet are they greater enemies to it, and ſeeke more to diſgrace it, then any other gift or grace whatſoeuer.
